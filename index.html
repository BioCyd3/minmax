                    <b>Barkplug</b> (UR, Electricity, Front)<br/>
                    <u>Summary:</u> The ultimate offensive force multiplier.
                    <hr/>
                    <b>Skill Breakdown:</b>
                    * <b>Basic (Maelstrom Bolt):</b> 281.2% chain lightning to 5 targets. Not high damage, but constantly applies pressure across the enemy team.
                    * <b>Rage (Overcharge):</b> 2331% single-target nuke with a 20% chance to Paralyze (skill lock). A powerful tool for deleting or disabling a priority threat.
                    * <b>Passive (Ion Disruption):</b> The reason for its S+ rank. ALL enemies suffer -20% Defense, permanently. This is a massive, unconditional damage amp for your entire squad.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Strategic Analysis:</b> Barkplug fundamentally changes every fight it enters. Its passive makes every other damage dealer on your team exponentially better. The strategy is simple: deploy Barkplug, and watch your team's damage numbers skyrocket. Its Rage skill is the cherry on top, allowing you to remove a problematic enemy healer, tank, or damage dealer from the equation.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Synergies:</b>
                    * <u>Everyone.</u> Most notably with high-damage AoE Pals (<b>Mantleray, Blazeal</b>) who can capitalize on the team-wide defense shred.
                    * Works exceptionally well with single-target nukers (<b>Lucidina</b>) to ensure their overkill potential on priority targets.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Counters & Weaknesses:</b>
                    * <u>Focus Fire:</u> Barkplug is not exceptionally tanky. A coordinated assault with single-target damage dealers can eliminate it before its value snowballs.
                    * <u>Back-row Assassins:</u> <b>Hoofrit</b> can target and potentially stun/kill Barkplug if it's placed incorrectly.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Economic Value:</b> Standard Charging worker. Its combat utility is so immense that using it for work is a significant opportunity cost unless you have duplicates.

                    <b>Statchew</b> (UR, Earth, Front)<br/>
                    <u>Summary:</u> The ultimate defensive anchor, enabling any strategy.
                    <hr/>
                    <b>Skill Breakdown:</b>
                    * <b>Basic (Gnash):</b> Solid 525.4% single-target damage. Respectable for a tank.
                    * <b>Rage (Protective Roar):</b> Debuffs enemy front-row, making them deal 13.5% less damage for 5s. Excellent for mitigating incoming damage during enemy burst phases.
                    * <b>Passive (Sentinel):</b> The cornerstone of its power. All allied front-row Pals take -20% damage. This is a constant, powerful defensive aura.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Strategic Analysis:</b> Statchew's role is to make your front line unbreakable. The combination of its passive aura and active debuff creates a wall that is incredibly difficult for most teams to breach. This buys invaluable time for your back-line damage dealers to execute their strategy without fear of being overrun. It enables otherwise 'glass cannon' team compositions to function.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Synergies:</b>
                    * <u>Fragile Back-liners:</u> Protects high-damage, low-HP Pals like <b>Lucidina</b> and <b>Mantleray</b>, allowing them to fire at will.
                    * <u>Bruisers:</u> Pals like <b>Dolphriend</b> or <b>Baboom</b> become incredibly durable when paired with Statchew, forming an impenetrable front.
                    * <u>Healers:</u> <b>Lendanear</b>'s healing becomes far more effective on a front line that is already taking reduced damage.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Counters & Weaknesses:</b>
                    * <u>Back-row Assassins:</u> <b>Hoofrit</b> bypasses the protected front row entirely to hit your squishy back line.
                    * <u>Defense Shred:</u> <b>Barkplug</b> can partially negate Statchew's tankiness by reducing its defense.
                    * <u>Overwhelming AoE:</u> While it protects the front, it does nothing for the back row against massive AoE like <b>Mantleray</b>'s bombs.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Economic Value:</b> A standard Mining worker. Its role as the game's premier tank makes it far too valuable for manual labor.

                    <b>Lucidina</b> (UR, Water, Back)<br/>
                    <u>Summary:</u> The queen of single-target elimination.
                    <hr/>
                    <b>Skill Breakdown:</b>
                    * <b>Basic (Phantasm):</b> 525.4% single-target damage. A strong and consistent poke.
                    * <b>Rage (Torment):</b> Deals a staggering 2590% damage to one target and makes them receive +10% more damage. This is a death sentence for almost any Pal.
                    * <b>Passive (Dream Shadow):</b> A simple but devastating +30% Crit Rate. This makes her damage output consistently high.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Strategic Analysis:</b> Lucidina is a scalpel. Her job is to identify the single most important enemy on the field—be it a healer, a key damage dealer, or a tank—and remove them. The damage amplification on her Rage skill also benefits the rest of your team. She is the ultimate solution to problematic individual Pals.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Synergies:</b>
                    * <u>Defensive Tanks:</u> <b>Statchew</b> is her best friend, keeping her safe while she aims.
                    * <u>Debuffers:</u> <b>Barkplug</b>'s defense shred makes her 'Torment' skill even more certain to one-shot its target.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Counters & Weaknesses:</b>
                    * <u>Back-row Access:</u> She is a prime target for <b>Hoofrit</b>.
                    * <u>Taunt/Redirects:</u> Any ability that can force her to target a less valuable enemy will waste her powerful Rage skill.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Economic Value:</b> Watering. A combat monster that should be on the field, not at the well.

                    <hr/>
                    <b>Skill Breakdown:</b>
                    * <b>Basic (Fiery Charge):</b> High 840.64% damage to a single enemy, making it a threatening presence even without Rage.
                    * <b>Rage (Blazing Volley):</b> Deals 2497.5% damage to the enemy's BACK ROW with a 60% chance to stun for 2s. This is a game-winning skill.
                    * <b>Passive (Hard-Horned):</b> +30% max HP, giving it the durability it needs to survive on the front line and execute its strategy.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Strategic Analysis:</b> Hoofrit breaks the standard rules of engagement. While most teams battle front-to-front, Hoofrit allows you to bypass the enemy tanks and directly attack their vulnerable core. Eliminating or stunning the enemy's key damage dealers or supports can win the fight before it truly begins.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Synergies:</b>
                    * <u>AoE Follow-up:</u> Pals like <b>Mantleray</b> or <b>Blazeal</b> can clean up the back row after Hoofrit has softened them up.
                    * <u>Front-line Support:</u> <b>Statchew</b> makes Hoofrit even tankier, ensuring it can use its Rage skill.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Counters & Weaknesses:</b>
                    * <u>High Single-Target Burst:</u> Must be eliminated quickly before it can use its Rage skill.
                    * <u>Well-Positioned Tanks:</u> Some formations can protect the back-line better than others, though none are immune.
                    <br/>

                    <hr/>
                    <b>Skill Breakdown:</b>
                    * <b>Rage (Flamewing Dive):</b> A solid 1375% line AoE attack. Decent for an SSR.
                    * <b>Passive (Eagle Eye):</b> Its S-Tier purpose. Generates high-quality intel quests and boosts treasure rewards by up to 42%. It literally creates wealth out of thin air.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Strategic Analysis:</b> Incineraptor's rank is based *exclusively* on its economic power. In a game about resource accumulation, no other Pal provides such a massive and sustained boost to your income of rare materials. It accelerates your ability to upgrade other Pals, buildings, and gear. It is a long-term investment with unmatched returns. Its combat ability is secondary but serviceable for an SSR.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Synergies:</b> Your entire account. The faster you get resources, the faster everything else grows.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Counters & Weaknesses:</b> In combat, it's a standard SSR back-liner. It's vulnerable to assassins and high burst.

Its +20% Attack passive is solid, and its Rage skill combines good damage (1350%) with a 70% chance for a 2.5s Freeze. This makes it a reliable damage dealer and controller that can fit into many teams until a top-tier UR is acquired.
                    <br/>
                    <b>Synergies:</b> Any standard team needing a solid back-line DPS.

                    <u>Summary:</u> An excellent and accessible pure tank.
                    <hr/>
                    <b>Strategic Analysis:</b> For players without Statchew, Platyputz is a fantastic alternative. Its passive provides a personal -20% damage reduction, and its Rage skill shields a low-HP ally. It does the job of a tank—soaking damage and protecting allies—reliably and effectively.

                    <b>Strategic Analysis:</b> These Pals are C-Tier in a late-game context, but S-Tier for a new player. The +35% resource bonus they provide is critical for getting your base off the ground. Their entire purpose is to fill worker slots effectively until you can acquire their direct SSR upgrades. They are a necessary and important step in progression.

                    <hr/>
                    <b>Strategic Analysis:</b> Auktyke is notable for being one of the only SR Pals with a combat-focused passive (+15% HP). This makes it the default choice for a front-line tank in the earliest stages of the game. It serves its purpose of absorbing hits but should be replaced by any SSR or UR tank as soon as possible.
