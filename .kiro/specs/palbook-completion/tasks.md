# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze current palbook.html file structure and identify truncation point


  - Examine the current file to understand where the truncation occurs
  - Identify any embedded data that conflicts with external data files
  - Document the exact location where the file needs to be completed
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Remove embedded data and complete HTML structure


  - Remove any embedded Palmon data from the HTML file
  - Ensure the HTML document has proper closing tags for all elements
  - Verify the body and html tags are properly closed
  - Maintain the existing script loading order and structure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Validate HTML document structure and external resource references


  - Verify all external CSS and JavaScript files are properly referenced
  - Confirm the data/palbook-data.js file is loaded before scripts/palbook.js
  - Ensure all HTML tags are properly nested and closed
  - Validate that no duplicate or conflicting data sources exist
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 4. Test page functionality with external data source


  - Load the completed palbook.html file in a browser
  - Verify that Palmon cards render correctly using external data
  - Test search and filter functionality works properly
  - Confirm all interactive elements function as expected
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3_
