  <h1>Threat Analysis: The NAP 20 Protocol</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center; color: #555;">// EYES ONLY - LEAK AND BE ZEROED //</p>
  <p>This document is a server-agnostic analysis of the Non-Aggression Pact (NAP) phenomenon, a recurring socio-economic structure observed in kingdom-builder war games. Its purpose is to dissect the protocol's function, incentives, and predictable lifecycle, thereby providing a clear-eyed understanding of the system that actively stifles competition and precipitates server death.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>I. Functional Definition</h2>
  <p>A "NAP 20" (the number being variable) is presented to the general server population as a treaty for peace and stability. This is a deliberate misrepresentation.</p>
  <p>In practice, the NAP is a <span class="term">Resource & Power Cartel</span>. It is an extra-governmental body formed by the server's top-spending alliances to achieve three primary objectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Risk Elimination:</b> To insulate the significant real-money investments of their top members from the inherent risks of organic, peer-to-peer conflict.</li>
    <li><b>Market Control:</b> To monopolize the server's most valuable resources, territories, and event rewards, creating a closed economic loop that benefits only its members.</li>
    <li><b>Competitive Suppression:</b> To systematically halt the progression of any non-member alliance that demonstrates the potential to challenge their dominance, thereby cementing a permanent power hierarchy.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>The NAP does not prevent war. It nationalizes it. The NAP council becomes the only body with the legitimate authority to sanction violence, which it then uses to enforce its own economic and social policies.</blockquote>

  <hr>

  <h2>II. Anatomy of a NAP Server: A Stratified Ecosystem</h2>
  <p>A mature NAP server is not a free-for-all; it is a rigidly stratified pyramid. This is not a theory; it is an observable reality. Your gameplay experience, your potential for growth, and your ultimate fate on this server are determined by which tier of this pyramid you occupy. Below is the unfiltered truth of your position.</p>

  <div class="section-break">...</div>

  <h4>TIER 1: The Inner Council (Ranks #1-5) - <span class="term">The Gods of the Machine</span></h4>
  <p>These are not players in the same sense as you. They do not log on to "play" the war game; they log on to manage their investment. Their gameplay consists of Discord diplomacy, spreadsheet management of resource distribution, and the quiet, closed-door negotiations that decide the fate of thousands. They are the architects of the system.</p>
  <blockquote>"Look, just give Alliance #12 the third-place reward for this event. We need their activity for KvK, and their leader is getting noisy. We'll take first and second as usual. It keeps the peace."<br>—Actual sentiment from a Top 3 leadership channel.</blockquote>
  <p><strong class="truth">The Unfiltered Truth for You:</strong> You are a statistic on their spreadsheet. Your alliance's power level, your weekly activity score—these are metrics they use to decide who is useful and who is disposable. They do not know your name. They do not care about your ambitions. Your entire gameplay experience is a resource they consume to maintain the stability of their risk-free farming simulator.</p>

  <div class="section-break">...</div>

  <h4>TIER 2: The Buffer Zone (Ranks #6-20) - <span class="term">The Gilded Cage</span></h4>
  <p>You have the NAP tag. You are invited to the "town hall" meetings. You feel a sense of pride and security. This feeling is a carefully crafted illusion. You are not a partner; you are a high-value asset, and like all assets, you are expendable.</p>
  <blockquote>"We had to fight tooth and nail for a week against that new rogue alliance. Lost millions of troops. The #2 alliance sent a 'thank you' message and then poached our top player the day after, the one who got all the kill points for us. We did all the bleeding, they got the prize."<br>—An R4 from a #15 ranked alliance.</blockquote>
  <p><strong class="truth">The Unfiltered Truth for You:</strong> You are the server's professional cannon fodder. You are the human shield placed between the Inner Council and any real threat. Your designated role is to absorb the first wave, to bleed, to report back, and to hold the line while the whales decide if the fight is worth their time. The "privilege" of your position is the honor of dying first. Your players are their talent pool. Your territory is the frontline trench. Your continued existence in the NAP is contingent on your willing servitude. You are a well-treated slave, but a slave nonetheless.</p>

  <div class="section-break">...</div>

  <h4>TIER 3: The Fiefdoms (Sanctioned Non-NAP Alliances) - <span class="term">The Digital Sharecroppers</span></h4>
  <p>Your alliance leader has struck a deal. You've become an "academy," a "sub-farm," or an "official ally." In exchange for not being annihilated, you have sworn fealty. You are "protected."</p>
  <blockquote>"Our leader told us we can't hit NAP members' resource tiles, even if they take ours. We have to send a percentage of our resources to our 'protector' alliance every week. We're safe, but we're also poor. We haven't had a real war in months."<br>—A member of an "academy" alliance.</blockquote>
  <p><strong class="truth">The Unfiltered Truth for You:</strong> You are not protected; you are owned. You are a feudal serf working the digital land. You exist for one reason: to generate resources and players for your masters in the NAP. You are allowed to live in peace because a farmer does not burn his own fields. You have traded your ambition for a quiet life of managed poverty. You have no upward mobility. You are a resource node with a guild tag, and you are being harvested daily.</p>

  <div class="section-break">...</div>

  <h4>TIER 4: The Wildlands (Independent Alliances) - <span class="term">The Hunting Grounds</span></h4>
  <p>You are the truly free. You bend the knee to no one. You reject the system. You log on to fight and to grow on your own terms. In a healthy server, you would be lauded as a competitor. In a NAP server, you are designated as a disease.</p>
  <blockquote>"We just wanted to play the game. We started our own alliance with friends, and in two weeks we broke the top 30. Last night, we were hit by five different NAP alliances at once. The global chat called us 'server-wreckers' for trying to take a Level 2 resource zone. We were punished for being active."<br>—A new player in the Wildlands.</blockquote>
  <p><strong class="truth">The Unfiltered Truth for You:</strong> You are not a player; you are <span class="term">content</span>. You are the boars in the forest, the mobs in the dungeon. Your purpose in the ecosystem is to provide the NAP's lower-ranking members with something to kill to keep them from getting bored. Your struggles, your victories, your attempts to build something for yourself—they are all seen as a convenient excuse for the NAP to rally together and remind everyone of their absolute power. You are not a threat to be negotiated with; you are a pest to be exterminated. Your only path to survival is to unite with the other "pests" and become a plague they cannot ignore.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>III. Historical Precedents & The Cycle of Stagnation</h2>
  <p>The NAP protocol is a solved equation. The outcome has been observed across dozens of titles and thousands of servers. The result is always the same.</p>
  
  <h3>Case Study Post-Mortems:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Game:</b> Rise of Kingdoms<br><b>Result:</b> The "Dead Kingdom" phenomenon. After months of NAP-enforced peace, the server's player base is so unskilled in mass PvP that they are humiliated and annihilated in their first server-vs-server war. This triggers a mass exodus of the remaining active players, leaving the NAP council to rule over a ghost town.</li>
    <li><b>Game:</b> Lords Mobile<br><b>Result:</b> The "Guildfest Monotony." Alliances form massive coalitions that hold strict NAPs, turning the entire server into a PvE farming event. The only significant conflict is KvK. Player engagement plummets between events, and many guilds become top-heavy with powerful but inactive accounts.</li>
    <li><b>Game:</b> Evony: The King's Return<br><b>Result:</b> "The Server Farm." The entire server becomes a single, unified entity in preparation for SvS. Any internal fighting is deemed "treason." The game loses all strategic depth and becomes a simple resource-gathering and troop-building simulator for 95% of the time. Servers either bleed out or require mergers to survive.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This leads to the predictable <span class="term">Cycle of Stagnation</span>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b class="term">Phase 1 - Chaos:</b> Server launch. Organic warfare. High activity.</li>
    <li><b class="term">Phase 2 - Consolidation:</b> Whales tire of risk. The NAP is formed.</li>
    <li><b class="term">Phase 3 - Order:</b> The NAP solidifies control. The pyramid structure is cemented.</li>
    <li><b class="term">Phase 4 - Apathy:</b> The lack of meaningful conflict leads to boredom. Player activity drops. The server's overall skill level decays.</li>
    <li><b class="term">Phase 5 - Collapse:</b> The server either dies a slow death from inactivity or is mercy-killed by a more aggressive, active server in a server-wide event, triggering a final exodus.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p class="highlight">A NAP does not preserve a server. It embalms it.</p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <h2>IV. Server Health Diagnosis: Symptoms of NAP Disease</h2>
  <p>Is your server infected? The symptoms are clinical and easily observable.</p>
  <ul>
      <li><b class="term">[ ] A Dead Global Chat:</b> The primary sign of a sedated player base. When there is no conflict, there is nothing to talk about.</li>
      <li><b class="term">[ ] Scripted Events:</b> Top alliances "take turns" winning events or agree on reward distribution beforehand. There is no real competition.</li>
      <li><b class="term">[ ] "No Kill" Rules:</b> The NAP enforces complex rules about who can hit whom, when, and where. Hitting resource tiles may be forbidden. Attacking cities below a certain power level may be a "war crime." This is not peace; it is micromanagement.</li>
      <li><b class="term">[ ] Mass Migration of Mid-Core Players:</b> The most ambitious F2P and low-spenders start leaving the server for younger, more chaotic kingdoms.</li>
      <li><b class="term">[ ] Rise of the "Diplomat" Player:</b> The most influential figures on the server are not the best warriors, but the players who spend all day in Discord negotiating and managing the delicate NAP politics.</li>
      <li><b class="term">[ ] The Illusion of Choice:</b> You are "free" to do anything, as long as it does not challenge the established order in any meaningful way.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If you can check three or more of these boxes, your server is in the advanced stages of NAP-induced decay.</p>
