  <h1>NAP 20: The Truth</h1>

  <p>No spin. No sugar. This is the raw truth about the cartel that ruins competitive strategy games from the inside out.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>What is NAP 20?</h2>
  <p>A Non-Aggression Pact among the top 20 alliances in a server. It means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No attacks between the elites.</li>
    <li>Full coordination on events, zones, and rankings.</li>
    <li>Complete power lockout for all other alliances.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="highlight">It’s not peace. It’s a monopoly.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Where This Has Happened Before</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Rise of Kingdoms (RoK)</b>: Kingdoms often had massive NAP agreements between the top 3–5 alliances. Result? Dead kingdoms, mass migration, enforced farm zones.</li>
    <li><b>Game of War</b>: Early kingdoms had 20+ alliances form “Royal NAPs” to lock down events. Whales sat at the top. Everyone else bled out or quit.</li>
    <li><b>Lords Mobile</b>: Guild coalitions enforced cross-guild NAPs that prevented real war until KvK. Result? Only one hour of action every two weeks.</li>
    <li><b>Evony: The King’s Return</b>: NAPs between top alliances turned entire servers into AFK farms. Servers were restarted or bled dry of competition.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Every single time, the pattern is the same: <span class="highlight">NAP → stagnation → collapse</span>.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>The Real Reasons Behind NAP 20</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Fear of whales fighting each other.</b></li>
    <li><b>Desire to farm uninterrupted.</b></li>
    <li><b>Top alliances don’t want churn—they want obedience.</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It’s not about protecting the server. It’s about <span class="highlight">controlling it</span>.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>The Sales Pitch vs Reality</h2>
  <p><b>Pitch:</b> “We’re protecting new players.”<br>
     <b>Reality:</b> You’re herding them into resource zones and telling them not to PvP.</p>

  <p><b>Pitch:</b> “We’re preventing toxic drama.”<br>
     <b>Reality:</b> You’ve replaced drama with silence and made the game boring.</p>

  <p><b>Pitch:</b> “We’ll all grow stronger together.”<br>
     <b>Reality:</b> Only the top 5 grow. The rest stagnate or get kicked out when they fall behind.</p>

  <h2>The Lifecycle of a NAP Server</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Server launches. War is chaotic and raw.</li>
    <li>Whales get tired of risk. NAP 10 becomes NAP 20.</li>
    <li>Top alliances divide the map and stop fighting each other.</li>
    <li>Mid-tier alliances get crushed if they refuse to submit.</li>
    <li>Activity drops. Growth slows. Players quit. Events become scripted.</li>
    <li>Eventually, someone breaks the NAP. Civil war erupts. Server either resets... or dies.</li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h2>Symptoms of NAP Disease</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>“No kill zone” rules.</li>
    <li>Pre-scheduled wars only between non-NAP alliances.</li>
    <li>Fake PvP during events. Real coordination behind the scenes.</li>
    <li>Leadership council drama disguised as diplomacy.</li>
    <li>Whales dictating what “fun” looks like for everyone else.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>How to Break It</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Find the weak links. One inactive alliance inside the NAP can shatter trust.</li>
    <li>Expose hypocrisy: leaked DMs, favoritism, secret attacks.</li>
    <li>Unite the non-NAP alliances. Target one NAP elite and burn them relentlessly.</li>
    <li>Force escalation. Force chaos. Once blood spills, the spell breaks.</li>
    <li><span class="highlight">Make war inevitable again.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Final Word</h2>
  <p>NAP 20 is the illusion of order masking a dead game. If you want safety, go play idle clickers. If you want power, earn it through fire.</p>
  <p>There is no peace in war games. Only those too afraid to bleed.</p>

  <p class="highlight">Kill the NAP. Free the server.</p>
